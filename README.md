# Miercoles

**Pronunciation:** /mi-ER-ko-les/ (Spanish for "Wednesday")

A whimsical pet name generator inspired by Gomez Addams' impossibly adorable nicknames for his daughter Wednesday.

## Inspiration

This project was born from binge-watching Netflix's _Wednesday_ and falling in love with Gomez Addams' over-the-top terms of endearment for his daughter. The way he greets her with names like "my little tormenta" and "my little death trap" perfectly captures my newfound feline fatherhood.

Turns out, "Hi my little nightmare" hits different when you're addressing an 8-pound Siamese mix who play-fights with your feet at 7am to request breakfast. 😸
